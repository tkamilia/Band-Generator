# Band-Generator
Overview
The Band Generator Project is a simple web application that generates unique band names dynamically. This project, developed during my Web Development Bootcamp, showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery), Express.js, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript).

Features
Dynamic Band Name Generation: The application automatically generates creative band names without requiring user input.

Responsive Design: The project incorporates responsive design principles, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Express.js Server: The back end of the application is built using Express.js, a robust Node.js framework. This allows for efficient routing and handling of user requests.

EJS Templates: The project utilizes EJS (Embedded JavaScript) templates for server-side rendering. This enables the dynamic generation of HTML content based on data from the server.

jQuery Interactivity: jQuery is employed to enhance the interactivity of the user interface, providing a smoother and more engaging experience.
